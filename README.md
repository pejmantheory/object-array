Getting Started
Fork and clone this repo, and then cd into the cloned directory
all of the challenges are in the exercises.js file
Drills!
Make your way through exercises.js, answering the prompts. You can use console.log()s to test your answers and you can run the script with the command node exercises.js, if you have already installed node. Otherwise, just test your code in Repl.it, Codepen, or a similar sandbox environment!

Note that the answers are can be found in a soultion branch to this repo!

This point of this lab is not to just get the answers, the point is to work through the exercises yourself and use the answers as training wheels while you build your understanding.
